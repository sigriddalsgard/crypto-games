> *Three fun cryptography-based mini challenges: XOR, Proof of Work, and Merkle Trees — can you beat them all?*

## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to Crypto-Games, a trilogy of small C-based cryptographic challenges. Each game tests your understanding of different crypto concepts in a playful way. You must solve each game to unlock the next one.

### 🔓 Game 1: XOR Decryption

You are given an encrypted message — shown as a sequence of hexadecimal values.  
Your task is to decrypt it using the XOR key provided.  
If you get the original string right, you’ll move on to the next game!

### 🔥 Game 2: Proof of Work (Lite Version)

This is a simplified Proof of Work (PoW) challenge.  
You're given a random nonce, and you must find some data in hexadecimal format.  
When the nonce and your data are combined and hashed, the resulting hash must begin with the bytes: `b0 0b`.

### 🌳 Game 3: Merkle Tree Guessing Game

You're presented with a Merkle root hash and a list of names.  
Only four names are included in the Merkle Tree.  
Your task is to guess which four names are in the tree and in the correct order.  
If your guess results in a matching Merkle root — you win!
